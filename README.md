We live in a world where open-source, decentralized and safe is becoming the expected of all companies and programs, this is a project to help companies move to open source and decentralized systems.

## The past
Before we talk about what needs and is happening in the future, we need to talk about the past. In the past most companies didn't even reconise the open-source community and kept their programs, alogorithims and such closed-source and did not ever share them to the public. Yet in many diffrent ways, companies work and programs had started to become open-source, but not because they chose to, because they were being hacked. One of the main ways hackers damage companies is by releasing their software to the public, for free, on websites like github! Now keep in mind some source is sold instead of just being released immediately by the hacker, but most of the time it will eventually get leaked by the person who bought it or someone else who has a copy.
